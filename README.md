**Mockolate** is a modern, strongly-typed, AOT-compatible mocking library for .NET, powered by source generators.
It enables fast, compile-time validated mocking with .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 8, .NET 10 and .NET Framework 4.8.

- **Source generator-based**: No runtime proxy generation.
- **Fast**: Direct dispatch with no reflection or dynamic proxies.
- **Strongly-typed**: Compile-time safety and IntelliSense support.
- **AOT compatible**: Works with Native AOT and trimming.
- **Modern C#**: First-class support for ref structs, static interface members, and current language features.

## Why Mockolate

|                | Reflection-based mocks (Moq, NSubstitute, …) | Mockolate                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| AOT / trimming | not supported                                | supported                  |
| Validation     | runtime exceptions                           | analyzers + compile errors |
| Setup API      | `Expression<Func<…>>` trees                  | regular method calls       |
| Hot path       | dynamic-proxy dispatch                       | direct dispatch            |

For side-by-side setup, usage, and verification syntax against Moq, NSubstitute, and FakeItEasy, see the
[full code comparison](https://docs.testably.org/Mockolate/comparison); for performance, see the
[benchmarks](https://docs.testably.org/Mockolate/benchmarks).

Already on Moq or NSubstitute? The companion package [`Mockolate.Migration`](https://github.com/Testably/Mockolate.Migration)
ships analyzers and code fixers that translate common Moq and NSubstitute patterns to Mockolate syntax in-place: point it
at an existing test project and apply the suggested fixes.

## Installation

Install the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0). Mockolate leverages C# 14
extension members (the projects can still target any supported framework). Then add the package:

```powershell
dotnet add package Mockolate
```

## Quick Start

```csharp
using Mockolate;

public interface IChocolateDispenser
{
    bool Dispense(string type, int amount);
}

// Create a mock
IChocolateDispenser sut = IChocolateDispenser.CreateMock();

// Setup: Dispense returns true for any Dark chocolate request
sut.Mock.Setup.Dispense("Dark", It.IsAny<int>()).Returns(true);

// Act
bool success = sut.Dispense("Dark", 4);

// Verify
sut.Mock.Verify.Dispense("Dark", It.IsAny<int>()).Once();
```
