# Analyzers

Mockolate ships with some Roslyn analyzers to help you adopt best practices and catch issues early, at compile time.
All rules provide actionable messages and link to identifiers for easy filtering.

## Mockolate0001

`Verify` methods only return a `VerificationResult` and do not directly throw. You have to specify how often you expect
the call to happen, e.g. `.AtLeastOnce()`, `.Exactly(n)`, etc. or use the verification result in any other way.

**Example:**

```csharp
IChocolateDispenser sut = IChocolateDispenser.CreateMock();
sut.Dispense("Dark", 1);
// Analyzer Mockolate0001: Add a count assertion like .AtLeastOnce() or use the result.
sut.Mock.Verify.Dispense(It.Is("Dark"), It.IsAny<int>());
```

The included code fixer suggests to add the `.AtLeastOnce()` count assertion:

```csharp
sut.Mock.Verify.Dispense(It.Is("Dark"), It.IsAny<int>()).AtLeastOnce();
```

## Mockolate0002

Mocked types must be mockable. This rule will prevent you from using unsupported types:

- `CreateMock()`  
  Type must be an interface, a delegate or a supported class (e.g. not sealed)
- `Implementing<T>()`  
  Type must be an interface

It also fires when the type has a member that the mock would have to implement (an abstract member,
or an interface member without a default implementation) but that is not accessible from your
assembly: for example an `internal abstract` or `private protected abstract` member, or a
`{ get; internal set; }` property, on a type from a referenced assembly that does not grant
`InternalsVisibleTo`. There is no valid code a mock could emit for such a member, so the type cannot
be mocked at all.

The rule only considers members the mock is still obliged to implement. If a more derived type in the
referenced assembly already overrides the inaccessible member, the obligation is discharged and the
type stays mockable:

```csharp
// In a referenced assembly that does not grant InternalsVisibleTo:
public abstract class Dispenser
{
    internal abstract void Refill();
}

public abstract class ChocolateDispenser : Dispenser
{
    internal override void Refill() { }  // obligation discharged
}

// Mockolate0002 fires for Dispenser, but ChocolateDispenser mocks fine.
ChocolateDispenser sut = ChocolateDispenser.CreateMock();
```

`Refill` itself is not part of the mock's surface, since your assembly cannot see it. An
`internal abstract override` re-declaration is not a discharge: it continues the obligation without
implementing it, so the rule still fires.

The same applies per accessor. For a property whose accessors differ in accessibility, such as
`public abstract string Flavour { get; internal set; }`, an override further down discharges only the
inaccessible half. The mock then overrides the accessor it can see and leaves the other one to the
referenced assembly's implementation. Because writes never reach the mock, `Setup` and `Verify` expose
only the getter for such a property, so a write that could never be recorded is not offered for
configuration or verification. The same narrowing applies to indexers. See
[properties with only one accessor](setup/properties#properties-with-only-one-accessor) and
[indexers with only one accessor](setup/indexers#indexers-with-only-one-accessor) for details.

## Mockolate0003

A mocked member's signature routes through the ref-struct pipeline in a way Mockolate can't
emit setup surface for. The warning fires in two distinct situations.

**1. Compilation prerequisites not met**

The ref-struct setup pipeline requires both:

- A target framework of .NET 9 or later (Mockolate's ref-struct setup types are
  `#if NET9_0_OR_GREATER`-gated).
- An effective C# language version of 13 or later (uses the `allows ref struct` anti-constraint).

When either prerequisite is missing, the warning fires for any member that passes a non-`Span<T>` /
non-`ReadOnlySpan<T>` ref struct by value, or uses one as an indexer key. Upgrade the target
framework and/or `<LangVersion>` to resolve it.

**2. Signature shapes that are never supported**

These fire on every compilation target, including .NET 9+ / C# 13+:

- Parameters marked `out`, `ref`, or `ref readonly` whose type is a non-`Span<T>` /
  non-`ReadOnlySpan<T>` ref struct - the mock can't round-trip the value through
  `IOutParameter<T>` / `IRefParameter<T>` when `T` is a ref struct.
- Methods returning a non-`Span<T>` / non-`ReadOnlySpan<T>` ref struct.

**Note:**
`Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` flow through the existing `SpanWrapper` / `ReadOnlySpanWrapper`
fallback and are never flagged. On .NET 9+ with C# 13+, by-value custom ref-struct parameters and
ref-struct-keyed indexers (getter-only, setter-only, and get+set) are fully supported.

See the [Ref Struct Parameters](setup/parameter-matching#ref-struct-parameters-net-9) section
for the supported surface.
