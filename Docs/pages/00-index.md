[**Mockolate**](https://github.com/aweXpect/Mockolate) is a modern, strongly-typed, AOT-compatible mocking library for .NET, powered by source generators.
It enables fast, compile-time validated mocking with .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 8, .NET 10 and .NET Framework 4.8.

- **Source generator-based**: No runtime proxy generation.
- **Fast**: Direct dispatch with no reflection or dynamic proxies.
- **Strongly-typed**: Compile-time safety and IntelliSense support.
- **AOT compatible**: Works with Native AOT and trimming.
- **Modern C#**: First-class support for ref structs, static interface members, and current language features.

## Why Mockolate

|  | Reflection-based mocks (Moq, NSubstitute, …) | Mockolate |
|---|---|---|
| AOT / trimming | not supported | supported |
| Validation | runtime exceptions | analyzers + compile errors |
| Setup API | `Expression<Func<…>>` trees | regular method calls |
| Hot path | dynamic-proxy dispatch | direct dispatch |

For side-by-side setup, usage, and verification syntax against Moq, NSubstitute, and FakeItEasy, see the [full code comparison](08-comparison.md).

Already on Moq? The companion package [`Mockolate.Migration`](https://github.com/aweXpect/Mockolate.Migration) ships analyzers and code fixers that translate common Moq patterns to Mockolate syntax in-place - point it at an existing test project and apply the suggested fixes.

## Getting Started

1. **Check prerequisites**  
   Install the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0), because Mockolate leverages
   C# 14 extension members (the projects can still target any supported framework).

2. **Install the package**
   ```powershell
   dotnet add package Mockolate
   ```

3. **Create and use a mock**
   ```csharp
   using Mockolate;

   public interface IChocolateDispenser
   {
       bool Dispense(string type, int amount);
   }

   // Create a mock
   IChocolateDispenser sut = IChocolateDispenser.CreateMock();

   // Setup: Dispense returns true for any Dark chocolate request
   sut.Mock.Setup.Dispense("Dark", It.IsAny<int>()).Returns(true);

   // Act
   bool success = sut.Dispense("Dark", 4);

   // Verify
   sut.Mock.Verify.Dispense("Dark", It.IsAny<int>()).Once();
   ```
